            <p>I was able to easily develop CSS skill and it naturally leads to JavaScript which is soon
                to be implemented in to web projects although there is somthing else prior which
                i have identified as useful. Bootstrap is a CSS framework which is for mobile compatibility
                and browser comapatability. Its an already developed framework but its important to understand
                how it actually works.

        <p> <br> Ive been working from project to project over the past year and 
            i have developed and completed many Python projects and web projects. Cascading style sheets seems
            a really valuable skill to learn. Combined with HTML the results are visually pleasing and
            gives instant gratification in the sense of digital production. The JavaScript is ready to be applied
            now. <br> <br>
            The CSS grid style is a good one. We can use 'grid-auto-flow: dense;' and 'grid-row-span: 2;', along
            with 'grid-column: span, 2;'. This means a dynamic grid layout with rectangles can be seen, and
            its compatible with mobiles. A grid with completley equal segements is boring and this sets a more
            abstract grid, its nice as you can see below.

        <br> We can use free computer software to make websites.
        Visual Studio Code is a source code editor. Its free and is a popular choice
        with developers.<br>
        HTML and CSS have excellent documentation and resources so as long as you have 
        a plan of what kind of page you intend to create,<br> it should be an achievable
        goal.<br>
        Learning new languages can be hard for some people, my advice is try to
        start with 30mins per day trying to learn somthing <br>new each time, and build it
        up from there. If you learn one new thing per session, <br>thats 30 new things
        you have learnt in a average month.

        Here is an image of a trello board that you can use to plan your project. Its system has three boards,
        To-do, doing and done.<br> The concept is to start madatory tasks in the To-do list, and as the 
        project moves forward, you move the item task into the <br>next list - doing. From then when you have competed
        that item, you would put it in the done list.
