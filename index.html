    <h1>Building websites for demonstration with HTML & CSS</h1>
    <h1>Dave Ikin @ CodeNation, Develop 2021</h1>
    <p>
    We can use free computer software to make websites.
    Visual Studio Code is a source code editor. Its free and is a popular choice
    with developers.<br>
    HTML and CSS have excellent documentation and resources so as long as you have 
    a plan of what kind of page you intend to create,<br> it should be an achievable
    goal.<br>
    Learning new languages can be hard for some people, my advice is try to
    start with 30mins per day trying to learn somthing <br>new each time, and build it
    up from there. If you learn one new thing per session, <br>thats 30 new things
    you have learnt in a average month.

        Here is an image of a trello board that you can use to plan your project. Its system has three boards,
        To-do, doing and done.<br> The concept is to start madatory tasks in the To-do list, and as the 
        project moves forward, you move the item task into the <br>next list - doing. From then when you have competed
        that item, you would put it in the done list.
